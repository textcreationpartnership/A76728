            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:134572:4"/> God for Counsel and Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, I thought on this Text spoken to in the following Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course; (for it was not at the least in my thoughts ever to publish this, or any other, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my own inability) I wrote in my homely Stile what thou wilt here find (all except the Title Page, This, and the Post-script) calculating it to the Capacities of the plainest Christians; to whom I then sent it, and with whom it lodg'd; until about six months since it pleased the only Wise God to bring me to a trial of my Faith and Patience; so deep a stroke it was, that I used all means for my sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; and it came into my Mind, that such a thing I had written so long before, to help in such Cases, and that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:134572:4"/> had found benefit by it, I made enquiry after it, and at last found it; and in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, <hi>as the Word of God,</hi> and begging God's Blessing on it, I found much Relief and Comfort thereby, (all Praise and Thanks to <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 4, 5.</note> God) and thereupon had some small Inclinations to comuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the same to others; and after many struglings and reluctancies in my self, and with Prayers and Tears I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought the Lord to direct me: At last I considered, I must shortly put off this my earthly Tabernacle, and having for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Years been lain aside like a broken Vessel of no use, and compassed with many bodily In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, I was willing to leave behind me a little scrap of my Labours to my Children and

            <p>But why so mean a thing as this among the learned Labours of so many eminent Writers on the like Subject?</p>

            </p>
            <p>What! might they say, Must we not be troubled at all? Must nothing trouble us? No, we must not be troubled for any outward Loss, for any outward Tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for parting with the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est and dearest Relation, we

            <p>We are always too prone to fall into Extreams, to sin either in Excess or in Defect, too much, or too little; we are faulty both ways. As for Sin, which is the worst of Evils, we are apt to be troubled too little. How few fail here in the Excess, tho 'tis possible so to do; and some have, that refuse to be comforted by

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Outward Cause. </seg>1</label> the first may be <hi>God</hi> himself. He
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:134572:21"/> sometimes withdraws the Beams of his Countenance, withholds the sense of his Love, hideth his Face from his Children: (which the Saints in Scripture so bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly complain of, and so earnestly <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Isa.</hi> 45. 15. <hi>Job</hi> 34. 29.</note> pray against). Whereupon the Souls, even of the strongest Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians are disquieted.

            <p>Secondly, The Devil is the <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Outward Cause. </seg>2</label> Cause sometimes of the Heart-Trouble of God's Children. For he being a cursed Spirit, cast out of Heaven, full of Disquietment and Discontent himself, labours all he can to trouble and disquiet others, to bring others (as much as in him lies) into the same cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Condition with himself: He being cast out of <hi>Paradise</hi> himself, envies us the <hi>Paradise</hi> of a good and quiet <hi>Conscience;</hi> for that is our Paradise until we come to Heaven: And this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise a poor Child of God may possess in a <hi>Prison,</hi> in a <hi>Dungeon,</hi> on a <hi>Dunghil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Two main Designs the Devil
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:134572:22"/> hath upon Men; the one is, if possibly, by all imaginable Slights, Temptations, and Inticements, he may keep Men in a course of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godliness, to hinder them from coming to Christ by <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> to deter them from his holy Ways. And when he cannot prosper in this, but that unsearchable rich and free Grace takes hold of some poor Souls, and they are snatch'd out of his Hands, their Captivity led cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive by that <hi>mighty Redeemer;</hi> then all the Devil's labour is, to hinder their Comfort, and to interrupt their Peace, and to make their way to Heaven as hard and uncomfortable to them as possible, pursuing them with all dejecting and Heart-troubling Temptations.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Wicked Men are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Outward Cause. </seg>3</label>
               <hi>active</hi> in the troubling of God's People; they are indeed the true Troublers of God's <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi> They load God's People with Reproaches: And there is nothing that the Nature of Man
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:134572:22"/> is more impatient of, than Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, for there is no Man so mean, but thinks himself worthy of some Respect; now a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful Scorn shews an utter disrespect of a Man, which flows from the very supersluity of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice. <hi>Reproach hath broken my Heart,</hi> saith <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 69. 20. and nothing more doth he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of than Reproach, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more are God's People lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to than this. These are the Causes from without.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There are Inward <note place="margin">Inward Causes.</note> Causes also of Heart-Trouble and Despondency: When God's People are in Affliction, most times that black Cloud of <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly</hi> also surrounds them, and Darkness makes Men fearful and dejected.</p>
            <p>There are many Causes within our selves. As, <hi>ignorance</hi> of God, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 9. 10. <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 6, 7.</note> and of Christ, of the Covenant of Grace, of the Name of God: they that know God's Name, will trust in him, and not be dejected. Also, forgetfulness of God, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:134572:23"/> of what he hath done for us. We <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Isa.</hi> 51. 12, 13.</note> forget God, when we are afraid of Man. Our <hi>overlooking,</hi> and passing by the many Comforts we enjoy, even while we are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Affliction, taking little No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of our <hi>Mercies,</hi> but let them <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 2.</note> be all swallowed up in our <hi>Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;</hi> as <hi>Abraham,</hi> because he had no Heir: and <hi>Rachel,</hi> who said, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 30. 1.</note>
               <hi>Give me Children, or I die;</hi> tho she had all other earthly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, yet the want of this <hi>one</hi> so troubled her, that all the <hi>rest</hi> seemed nothing.</p>
            <p>It is an evil thing for us to be wedded to our own Wills. None more subject to Discontent, than those who would have all things after their own way, and are meer Strangers to Self-denial. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, <hi>false apprehensions</hi> of things cause Heart-Trouble; to think God hates us, because he corrects us; and when he takes from us, that it is all in Wrath. Another common Cause, is our own <hi>watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lessness</hi>

            <p>Also when we are guilty of <hi>neglecting doing good</hi> to others, as to our <hi>Relations,</hi> not reproving, admonishing, or incouraging them as we ought, or have neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected to receive that good from them that we might, but now they are dead and gone, and we can no more do any good to <note place="margin">

               <hi>Fourthly, Despondency</hi> of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, Dejectedness, Distrust, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragment, are other pieces of <hi>Heart-Trouble.</hi> Such as was in <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 142. 3, 4, 5. and 143. 4. and <hi>Psal.</hi> 42. 5. Cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down breeds Disquietment, because it springs from <hi>Pride,</hi> which is a turbulent Passion; and every thing that crosseth and disappoints it, causeth a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustion in the Mind: When a Man cannot come down, and stoop to that condition that God casts him into, then is he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented; and this comes from his <hi>Pride.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Christian should be very careful to keep up his Spirits, when his condition in the World falls down. Could we but bring our Minds to our Conditions, to like and be pleased with our Conditions; as being certainly perswaded, that our present con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is best for us: It would be all as good, all as well, all as comfortable to us, as if we could bring our Conditions to
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:134572:32"/> our Minds; for one of these must be done, or else we shall never be free from <hi>Heart-Trouble</hi> while we live. Either our Minds must be brought just even to, and suted and compliant to our <hi>Conditions,</hi> be it Sickness, Poverty, Shame, Prison, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or, our <hi>Conditions</hi> must be suted just even to our <hi>Minds.</hi> We have a mind to Health, to Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we must have them, or we are troubled. Now, this <hi>latter</hi> is wholly and altogether out of our <hi>Power,</hi> we cannot <hi>add a Cubit to our Stature.</hi> It is the Lord that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points all our Conditions for us; we cannot make our Conditions Happy, Honourable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of our selves, and without God: But the <hi>former</hi> is in our <hi>Power,</hi> by the help of God's Spirit of Grace, we may bring our <hi>Minds</hi> to our <hi>Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi> it is an holy <hi>Art,</hi> attainable <note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 8.</note> in the use of God's means. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment</hi> in, and with our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, is the bringing of our <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 5.</note> Minds to our Conditions, to lie even, and sutable, and square one with the other; and this is, as
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:134572:33"/> I said, an holy Art, attainable by Christians, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 11. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had learned it, and so may <note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 6.</note> other Christians. It is the suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness between our Minds, and our Conditions, that breeds quiet and content: and if we have not quiet in our own Minds, all outward Comforts will do no more good, than a silken Stocken to a scabbed Leg; or, a golden Slipper, to a gouty Foot.</p>
            <p>Now, it is only God that can, but never will (except in wrath) bring any Man's Condition to his Mind; for then his Condition should be changed almost every moment; so mutable is Man's Mind: God will not bring the condition of the <hi>Wicked</hi> to their mind, (except in Wrath, as was said;) for, as their outward Prosperity doth increase, so do <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eccl.</hi> 4. 8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5. 10.</note> their desires after more: <hi>Cressit amor Nummi, &amp;c.</hi> And the wise Man tells us, <hi>The Eye is never sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with seeing.</hi> And the more <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Isa.</hi> 56. 11.</note>
               <hi>they</hi> have, the more <hi>they</hi> crave. <hi>They can never have enough.</hi> And
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:134572:33"/> for the <hi>Godly</hi> themselves, they are not so free from Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, as they should be, but still need to learn this Lesson of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, and to be learning of it all their days. And most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, if not always, God by his Grace brings their <hi>Minds</hi> to their <hi>Conditions,</hi> and not their <hi>Conditions</hi> to their <hi>Minds.</hi> And for this wise <hi>Agur</hi> prays, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 9. Two dangerous Extreams he prays against, the one is <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,</hi> that would breed <hi>Discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,</hi> in that his Mind would be <hi>below</hi> his Condition, debased to vile and sinful Practises, as Steal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The other is <hi>Riches,</hi> that would breed <hi>Discontent,</hi> in that his <hi>Mind</hi> would be above his <hi>Condition,</hi> and that would lift him up to base Pride, and forgetfulness of God; therefore he begs a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableness and conveniency be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his Mind and his Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>Feed me with food Convenient.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Certainly, we shall never be free from <hi>Heart-Trouble,</hi> till our <hi>Minds</hi> be brought sutable to our
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:134572:34"/>
               <hi>Conditions,</hi> and such a frame would prevent <hi>Casting-down</hi> in time of Affliction. To like our Condition, to be pleased and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with it, and with the holy Will of God in it; that is, to be content, content with Sickness, Poverty, Shame, Prison, loss of Relations and Friends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In a Word, when <hi>our Wills</hi> lie even with <hi>God's Will,</hi> (as in all reason they should,) and our <hi>Minds</hi> lie even with our <hi>Conditions,</hi> then have we inward Peace and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, Quietness and Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and never till then: and then Sickness is as good as Health; and Poverty as good as Riches; and a Prison, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this is that blessed Frame of Spirit we must labour for, and we our selves shall have the sweetness of it: otherwise, it is in a Man's <hi>Mind,</hi> as it is with the <hi>Body</hi> when Bones are out of Joint, there is nothing but pain <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 42. 5.</note> and trouble; but this bringing of our <hi>Minds</hi> to our <hi>Conditions,</hi> is as the Setting of the Bone
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:134572:34"/> again. Casting down our selves, Despondency, Discouragement, which arise from Discontent, are great pieces of <hi>Heart-Trouble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This distrust of God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence is a grand Evil; when we think we cannot live, unless we have a greater portion of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, and this sets us upon carking Cares, we know not how we and ours shall be provided for, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now this we may cure, <note place="margin">

Let us cast our selves on God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence: Will he provide for <hi>Ravens,</hi> and clothe <hi>Lillies,</hi> and neglect his own Children? It cannot be imagined.</p>
            <p>Earthly things are but a vain show, they can give us no joy of Heart, nor Peace of Conscience, they cannot add one Cubit to our Stature, nor one moment to our Lives.</p>
            <p>Moreover, this happy state of <note place="margin">

            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly; Persecution</hi> may cause <hi>Heart-Trouble;</hi> when Men are <hi>offended. Mat.</hi> 13. 21. when <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> was an <hi>offence</hi> to Christ, he was a trouble to him. Our Lord did on purpose foretel his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples what Persecutions they should undergo, that they might not be offended, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 1. fore-warn'd, fore-arm'd. It is a blessed thing not to be offended at persecution for Christ. He <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 31, 56.</note> foretold his Disciples, the Night before his <hi>Passion,</hi> that all of them should be offended at him that Night: Which came to pass, for one of them openly <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied</hi> him, and the rest <hi>forsook</hi> him and fled. To be troubled at Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:134572:35"/> for Christ's sake, is to be offended at the Cross of Christ; and that he would not have his Disciples to be by any means; <hi>Mark</hi> 8. last.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But is it not said, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 165. <hi>Great peace have they that love thy Law, and nothing shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ffend them?</hi> How then come the People of God to be offended?</p>
            <p>I Answer; They that truly love God's Law, because they love God, such shall have Peace with God, and with their own Consciences, and that is great Peace, and nothing shall offend them, that is, much trouble them, since they have peace with God, and with their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences: Outward Losses and Crosses are easily born, they shall make no breach upon their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Peace. They that have this Character of God's Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, will not be stumbled at God's Dispensations, let them be never so cross to their Desires, <note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 5.</note> because they have a God to fly unto in all their Troubles, and a
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:134572:36"/> sure Covenant to rest upon: Therefore the Reproaches cast on them, and on the Ways of God, do not scandalize them, for they have found God in that very way which others speak e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil of; they are not so offended by any thing that attends the Way of God, as to dislike or forsake that Way. Nevertheless, we must take heed that we be not offended.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly; Temptations</hi> from Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan may cause Heart-Trouble and Vexation: Satan's Sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions, his fiery Darts, these tormenting Thoughts which he casts into the Minds of Christ's Disciples, create to them much Disturbance and Heart-Trouble. So soon as any Man is pluck'd out of the Devil's Hands, by the mighty Power of Christ's Spirit, he falls upon him speedily with all his force, to trouble such a Soul and vex it; so that he shall enjoy little peace if Satan can hinder it. So long as the Devil <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 21, 22.</note> keeps <hi>possession</hi> in the Soul, he
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:134572:36"/> keeps all in peace, (a sad peace!) But when a <hi>stronger</hi> than he comes, and casteth out this strong Man armed, then Satan rageth, to recover his lost Captive Soul, and vexeth that Soul with all his Temptations. But let not this break your Peace, nor cause Heart-Trouble: As Christ hath overcome the World, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bids his Disciples to be of good chear, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 20. So hath he also overcome the Devil, he hath trodden this <hi>Serpent</hi> under his Feet already, and this <hi>Prince</hi> of Peace will tread him under your feet also shortly: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>let not your Hearts be troubled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly; Desertion,</hi> another (and not the least) piece of Heart-Trouble; this may be the case of Christ's Disciples. We read of the Saints complaining that God had <hi>forsaken</hi> them; and when he hideth his Face, they cannot but be troubled.</p>
            <p>Sometimes God doth but seem to hide his Face, <hi>Isa.</hi> 49. 14, 15. When God takes away their
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:134572:37"/> Earthly Comforts from them, and suffereth sharp and bitter Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions to befal them; and tho they cry unto him, he doth not remove them, then they think that God hath forsaken them.</p>
            <p>Sometimes God doth really forsake his People, as to the sense of his Favour; Isa. 54. 7, 8. <hi>For a small moment have I forsaken thee. In a little Wrath I hid my Face from thee for a moment.</hi> And this is, either by <hi>withhold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> comfort from them which they cry for; or by <hi>withdrawing</hi> that Comfort from them which they had; <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 11. &amp; <hi>Psal.</hi> 77. 1, 2, 3, 23. compared. Yet here God supported and sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Servant's Soul with Grace many times: when God's People have <hi>least Comfort,</hi> they have <hi>most Grace,</hi> most Humility, Patience, Self-denial, thirstings after God, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 80. 3, 7, 19. <hi>Psal.</hi> 63. 3.</note> Heavenly-mindedness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> God's People may lose the sense of his Love, but never lose his Love, for that is everlasting. But to lose the sense of his Love, is a
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:134572:37"/> grievous trouble to a gracious Soul, that hath tasted and felt the Love of God and his Favour; for their great Happiness is to have the Favour of God; <hi>In his Favour is Life,</hi> and <hi>his Loving-kindness is better than Life:</hi> This is the Joy of their Lives <hi>(Psal.</hi> 119. 135.) which <hi>David</hi> so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly prayed for. Now such as have found this, must needs be troubled when they lose it.</p>
            <p>Two things chiefly cause God to hide his Face from his People.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When their Hearts are too much set upon, and carried out after earthly Comforts, <hi>Psal.</hi> 30. 6, 7. Fleshly delight and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in earthly Things, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes God to hide his Face: When a Man smiles so much on the World, and gives it so much room in his Heart, God frowns, and is offended, that the <hi>Gift</hi> should be so much loved, and the <hi>Giver</hi> so neglected and forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When their Hearts are let out too little after God, and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:134572:38"/> there grows a <hi>strangeness</hi> between God and them, and they begin to grow cold, dull and dead in Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then God withdraws and hides himself, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 3, 5, 6. compared. But no Affliction like this, this disquieteth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecteth the People of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. And as all the Candles in the World cannot make it day when the Sun is set; so all the Comforts in the World cannot rejoice such a Soul, nor can there be any <hi>Day</hi> in such a Soul, until <hi>the Sun of Righteousness arise there</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mal.</hi> 4. 2.</note>
               <hi>with healing in his Wings.</hi> So much for this third Particular, shewing what this Heart-Trouble is, which our Lord here forbids his Disciples, namely, Worldly-Sorrow, sinful slavish Fear, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracting Care, Despondency, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectedness of Spirit, Distrust, offence at Persecution for Christ's sake, Satan's Tempations, and Spiritual Desertions, all which may eith<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Also this Faith in God, is, to believe that <hi>he is a Rewarder of them that diligently seek him.</hi>

               <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi> and will <hi>withhold no good thing from thee.</hi> I that am the infinite first and best <hi>Being</hi> of all Things, the living <hi>Fountain</hi> of all Mercy, the <hi>Original</hi> of all Power and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; I will be a God to thee, thy God, thy Father, if thou wilt take me for thy God, and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:134572:40"/> place all thy <hi>Happiness</hi> in me, and wilt become my Servant, and give up thy self sincerely to me, to serve and obey, to love and fear, and trust me only. This is to believe in God, to <hi>accept</hi> of God for our God, and to yield up our selves to him to be his People, <hi>Isa.</hi> 56. 46. to chuse the things that please him; to give him our Hearts, and become his Servants, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 26. 17, 18. And so God proposed himself to <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he called him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 1, 2, 3. as a <hi>Rewarder;</hi> and more fully, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 1. <hi>I am thy Shield, and thy exceeding great Reward;</hi> and so <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith was to act on God, so manifested: And, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 1. I am <hi>God</hi> All-sufficient; all-sufficient to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port thee in thy Way, and Work, and All-sufficient to reward thee in the end; therefore, be thou upright and faithful; let not thy Heart be troubled, what-ever Dangers and Difficulties thou meetest with in my Way and <note place="margin">

Also <hi>Moses</hi> his Faith <hi>had an eye to the Recompence of Reward,</hi> Heb. 11. 26. And that you may see that this is not <hi>legal</hi> and <hi>mercina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> our Lord Jesus proposeth this as an incouragement to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 12. <hi>Great is your Reward in Heaven.</hi> And he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self took incouragement from it, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 1, 2. <hi>for the Joy that was set before him,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>So that this is to believe in God, to believe that God is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and truly, He is <hi>All that</hi> which he hath revealed himself to be, and to believe that He is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Faith in God, Christ took for granted that his Disciples had; <hi>Ye believe in God;</hi> Ye believe that God is, and that he is a Rewarder of them that diligently seek him. And if ye believe this, let not your Hearts be troubled; be not afraid nor
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:134572:41"/> dejected, but act your Faith in God, and seriously consider what <hi>God</hi> that is in whom you believe; and believing also your <hi>Interest</hi> in that God, that He is your God, this God All-sufficient is your God, you will have no cause to be troubled: Your acting of Faith on God, your God, will prevent and cure your Heart-Trouble, and that these several ways.</p>
            <p>First, more generally.</p>
            <p>He that believes in God as his God, believes God is always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Isa.</hi> 41. 10. &amp; 43. 2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 5.</note> with him, according to his Promises. In the worst Times God is present with his People. And can there be any cause of Heart-Trouble to such Souls as have always the presence of God with them, whose Presence makes <hi>Heaven,</hi> and in whose <hi>Presence is</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 16. 11.</note>
               <hi>fulness of Joy,</hi> and <hi>at whose right Hand are Pleasures for evermore?</hi> Surely, Beloved, this will prevent Heart-Trouble, when a Soul can act his Faith, and firmly believe it. God is always present with
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:134572:41"/> his People, and that for graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Purposes, (and not as a bare Spectator); as to proportion and <hi>measure</hi> out their Afflictions <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 13. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 6. <hi>Isa.</hi> 27. 8.</note> to them, that they may not be above their <hi>strength,</hi> nor more than <hi>need.</hi> All the Afflictions of God's People are <hi>measured</hi> by the Hand of a most wise, most mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful and gracious God: all the Malice of Men and Devils can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not add a <hi>drachm</hi> to the Weight, nor a <hi>drop</hi> to the Measure, beyond God's appointment. He is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to order and fix the <hi>Time</hi> of <note place="margin">

All the Powers on Earth cannot bring trouble on us, till the <hi>Hour</hi> come, till the appointed Time, nor continue <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 125. 3.</note> our Troubles longer than his Time; The Rod of the Wicked shall not <hi>rest</hi> on the Lot of the Righteous. God is present, to

                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 10.</note> Cross, thereby to allay the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness of it, present to <hi>support</hi> the Soul with inward strength; Psal. 138. 3. <hi>Thou strengthenest me with strength in my Soul:</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to <hi>sanctify</hi> Afflictions for Good, and at length in his good Time, which is the best Time, when he hath perfected his own Work in his People, he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent for their full <hi>Deliverance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A true Believer in God hath always a God to go unto: O, what a Comfort, what an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness is that! He dwells in the Love of God as well in Affliction, as out of it; he may be cast out of his happy Condition in the World, but never out of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of his God: This believed by us, will cure Heart-Sorrow, Heart-Fear, Heart-Care, all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondency, Dejectedness, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietments and Distractions whatever. Faith acted on God, the Almighty, Allsufficient God, and our God, always present with us, is the Soveraign Antidote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:134572:42"/> and the best Cure of all Heart-Trouble, <hi>Psal.</hi> 142. 1, 2, 3, 4. there are the <hi>Psalmist</hi>'s Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; and, <hi>Vers.</hi> 5. there is his Cure; <hi>I cried unto thee, O Lord, Thou art my Refuge, and my Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Land of the Living.</hi> So, <hi>Psal.</hi> 143. 4, 6, 8. his Spirit was overwhelm'd with trouble; but he cried to God, and trusted <note place="margin">

This kept <hi>David</hi> from sinking under his great distress; 1 Sam. 30. 6. <hi>He encouraged himself in the Lord his God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus in general.</p>
            <p>More particularly, I shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to shew what there is in God that a Believer's Faith fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth virtue from to cure his Heart-Trouble in his greatest distress, even under the loss of the perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal presence of his best and dearest Friends on Earth; for such was like to be the Case of the Disciples in the Text.</p>
            <pb n="70" facs="tcp:134572:43"/>
            <p> First, <hi>That</hi> in God which Faith looks unto, and fetcheth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort from, is, his sweet and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <hi>Nature. God is Love,</hi> the very Element of Love, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 16. and his gracious <hi>Name,</hi> which discovers his Nature; <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 6. <hi>The Lord, gracious and merciful.</hi> When he gives to his People, he gives in love; when he takes, he takes in love. Now when a Soul believes, that all is from Love, and all in Love, he is supported. When a Man can believe that all his Troubles come to him from the Father of Mercies, and his Father in Christ, he cannot but bear them patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <hi>Ye believe in God,</hi> saith Christ, ye believe that God loves you, therefore, <hi>let not your Hearts be troubled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> But how shall I know that God loves me when he afflicts me?</p>
            <p>I answer; When we can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern that we have received any Spiritual Benefit by any Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we may certainly conclude, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 6, 10.</note> that the Love of God was in
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:134572:43"/> that Affliction. <hi>Fury</hi> is not in God towa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ds his People, <hi>Isa.</hi> 27. 4. <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 2.</note> And he intends nothing but our profit; all his ends are for our good: to purge away our Sins, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Job</hi> 23. 10.</note> to wean us from the World, to draw us nearer to himself, to <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17.</note> humble us, to try us, to conform us to Christ, to prepare us for Glory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now seeing God's Ends are so much for our good, we must conclude, That all our Afflictions proceed from his Love, and when we find any of those Ends accomplished in us, and on us; and that we have received real spiritual good by them, we ought to be strengthned in our Belief, that God hath corrected us in Love; so that Faith acted on the love of God in our Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, will prevent or cure our <hi>Heart-Trouble.</hi> Our Lord told his Disciples, <hi>That the Father had loved them,</hi> John 16. 27.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Faith acted upon God's Glorious <hi>Attributes,</hi> will fortify against Heart-Trouble.</p>
            <p>First, upon his <hi>All-sufficiency,</hi>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:134572:44"/> Ye believe, that God is All-suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, in, and of himself alone; <note place="margin">
                  <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n.</hi> 17. 1.</note> every way <hi>able to supply</hi> all Wants, to make up, and <hi>repair</hi> all Losses, to <hi>satisfy</hi> all Desires, to <hi>sustain</hi> under all Burdens, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all Earthly Comforts: for, how else are the Saints in Heaven happy, who have none of these Earthly Enjoyments? Ye believe this, act your faith on it: He must needs be All-sufficient who made the World, and all things in it, and upholds it to this day; He that owns all things, and is Possessor of Heaven and Earth, He it is, that is your God, your Father; act your Faith on him, and be comforted.</p>
            <p>He is All-mighty; you believe <note place="margin">2<hi>ly.</hi>
               </note> this. So Christ hath told his Disciples, <hi>All things are possible to God.</hi> He can break the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Heart, and can bind up the most broken Spirit: He can make up the greatest Loss. <hi>We are kept</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5.</note>
               <hi>by the mighty Power of God.</hi> Oh, how safe is that Man, that is in the Love and Covenant, and that
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:134572:44"/> lies in the <hi>Arms</hi> and Bosom of the <hi>Almighty</hi> God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 27. <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Job</hi> 9. 12.</note> He can bring Light out of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and make the greatest <hi>Loss,</hi> to prove the greatest <hi>Gain.</hi> He <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 26.</note> hath the <hi>Keys</hi> of the Grave, <hi>to him belong the issues from death.</hi> All <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 14.</note> Power belongeth to him; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is too hard for him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> His absolute <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty</hi> and <hi>Supremacy:</hi> All Souls are his, <hi>Ez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>k.</hi> 18. 4. He gives, he takes, <hi>who can hinder him?</hi> May he not do with his own what pleaseth him? Ye believe this. Hath he not a <hi>Right</hi> in all the Works of his hands, and may he not <hi>dispose</hi> of all as he will?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> His <hi>Ʋnchangeableness. God is in one mind,</hi> Job 23. 13, 14. The thoughts of his Heart stand to all Generations. He sets bounds to the Sea, to the Life of Man, and to all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of Life; the number of his Months is with God. Believe <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Job</hi> 14. 5.</note> this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> His <hi>Wisdom.</hi> God is
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:134572:45"/>
               <hi>only wise,</hi> the Fountain of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; he doth all he doth in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Wisdom. He is wise in Heart, and worketh all things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the counsel of his Will. He knows what is best for us; when to give, when to take, and what will do us most good. Believe this, <hi>And let not your Hearts be troubled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> His <hi>Righteousness.</hi> All his Waies are just and equal: Yea, when Clouds and Darkness are round about him, (his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences towards us dark,) yet then, <hi>Righteousness and Judgment are the habitation of his Throne.</hi> God, the Judge of the World, can do no wrong: believe this of God, and it will quiet your minds.</p>
            <p>Lastly, His <hi>Faithfulness: In faithfulness thou hast afflicted me,</hi> saith holy <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 119. 75. He hath promised, he will with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 84. 11.</note> no good thing from his People: Now he sees and knows that Afflictions are good for them, good for their Souls; his
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:134572:45"/> daily Rod as good for their Souls, as his <hi>daily Bread</hi> is for their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Therefore he brings Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions on them, and so makes good his Promise to them. O believe this, <hi>and let not your hearts be troubled.</hi> Certainly, Faith acted on God's <hi>Attributes</hi> will support under the greatest Stroaks, and most grievous Losses.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Faith acted on the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Particular.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>of Grace.</hi> God's ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Covenant will help to support under Trouble. Ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in God, that God hath made a Covenant with you, to become your God, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 31. 33. <hi>I will be your God, and ye shall be my people.</hi> This is infinitely more, for God to become our God, to give himself to us, than if he had said, I will give you Crowns and Kingdoms, Sons and Daughters: when God saith, <hi>I will be your God,</hi> he saith, I will be <hi>All that</hi> to you, and I will do <hi>All that</hi> for you, and bestow <hi>All that</hi> upon you, which a God can be, or do,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:134572:46"/> and which shall make you most <hi>happy</hi> for ever. I will pardon your Sins; I will give you new Hearts, give you my Spirit; I will give you <hi>Grace</hi> here, and <hi>Glory</hi> hereafter. This Acting of Faith in God's Covenant sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported <hi>David</hi> in his greatest Troubles; 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 5. a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Text: When the Lord had made breach upon breach in his Family, this Comforted him, <hi>that God had made with him an everlasting Covenant.</hi> That he was in Covenant with God; that God was his God in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: this ballanced all his Losses, and repaired all the Brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches made in his Relations: tho' his Family was wasted and blast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, this answered all, That <hi>he was in Covenant with God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the Language of Faith; If God be my God, if I be his Child, born of him, reconciled to him, pardoned, justified, sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, in Covenant with him; Why am I troubled, though he give me neither Health, nor
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:134572:46"/> Wealth, nor Friends, nor Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? Have I not enough, in having God to be my God? Is not God more than All? But if God be not my God; I have cause enough to be troubled then, considering the Danger I am in; and my Trouble for this should swallow up all other Trouble. For surely, either God is mine in Covenant, or he is not; if he be mine in Covenant, then, tho' he break my Family, make brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches upon all my earthly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts; yet, he will not break his Covenant, <hi>Psal.</hi> 89. 32. and so long I am well enough. If he leave me neither Son, nor Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if he strip me of Friends, Estate, Liberty, Health, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet he remains my God still; and so long it is well enough; it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ill with a Man so long as God is his; ye Believe this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly.</hi> Faith acted upon the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
               <note place="margin">

               </note>
               <hi>Word</hi> of God, will support the Soul; Ye Believe God's Word, the Word of Truth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:134572:47"/> 50. <hi>This is my Comfort in my Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, thy Word hath quickned me.</hi> So <hi>ver.</hi> 92. <hi>Had not thy Law been my Delight, I had perished in my Affliction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, Consider the Word of <hi>Precept:</hi> as in the Text, it is Christ's Command, <hi>Let not your hearts be troubled.</hi> Many such <note place="margin">1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 4. 13, 14.</note> Commands we have in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as, <hi>not to fear, not to be cast down, sorrow not as those that have no hope,</hi> and such like; now, Faith applies such Commands to the Soul; I must not be troubled in my heart, God forbids it. Why must we not prophane the Sabbath, nor Swear, nor Lie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but because God hath forbidden these Evils? So here, God hath forbidden us to be troubled, and commanded us to be quiet, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, contented, submissive to his Will in all his dealings; thus we should urge God's command on our Souls: Yea, we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be so far from trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling our selves when Afflictions befal us, as that we must <hi>count</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Consider the Word of <hi>Promise:</hi> Many exceeding great and precious Promises are in the Word of God, which are <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Isa.</hi> 41. 10. and 43. 2.</note> as a full Feast for Faith to feed upon. God promiseth to be our God, to be with us in the Fire, and in the Water; to support and sustain us, to lay no more <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 13.</note> upon us, than he will enable us to bear: <hi>That all things shall work together for our good,</hi> Rom. 8. 28.

               <hi>Ends</hi> and Designs of God in afflicting us, and removing our earthly Comforts from us, will prevent Heart-trouble. God hath holy and good Ends which Faith looks unto: God aims at our <hi>Profit:</hi> as <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 10. Such Ends as these,</p>
            <p n="1">1. God's End is, to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and purge away our Sins, <hi>Isa.</hi> 27. 9. <hi>By this shall the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of</hi> Jacob <hi>be purged, this is all the fruit, to take away his Sin.</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="4">4. To draw our Hearts nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to himself: Therefore many times God takes away our earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Comforts from us, because they had too much of our Hearts, and because they lay between God, and our Hearts, and kept us at a distance from him.</p>
            <p n="5">5. To bestow greater, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Mercies upon us. God never takes away any <hi>Darling-</hi>Comfort from his People, but his Design is, to give a better in the room of it; as in the Text, Christ leaves his Disciples, in regard of his Bodily Presence, because he would send the <hi>Comforter</hi> to them, which should abide with them for ever, <hi>John</hi> 14. 16.</p>
            <p n="6">6. To make them partakers of his Holiness, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 10.</p>
            <p n="7">7. To fit and prepare them for that far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17. These are God's holy, and good Ends in Afflicting his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, unto which Faith looks,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:134572:50"/> and so supports the Heart.</p>
            <p>Thus you see, how Faith acted on God in these Particulars, will prevent or cure all our Heart-Troubles: Faith acted on the sweet and gracious <hi>Nature</hi> of God; He is <hi>Love,</hi> all Love; on his glorious <hi>Attributes,</hi> his <hi>All-sufficiency,</hi> his <hi>Omnipotency,</hi> his absolute <hi>Soveraignty,</hi> his <hi>Ʋn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeableness,</hi> his <hi>Wisdom,</hi> his <hi>Righteousness,</hi> his <hi>Faithfulness,</hi> Faith acted on God's gracious everlasting <hi>Covenant;</hi> on the <hi>Word</hi> of God, on the Word of <hi>Precept,</hi> of <hi>Promise,</hi> of <hi>Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> of <hi>Example,</hi> of <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> And Faith acted on the <hi>Work</hi> of God, on the <hi>Will</hi> of God, and on his holy <hi>Ends</hi> in all his Chastisements. I say, Faith thus acted on God, will exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly support under all Trouble. <hi>Let not your Hearts be troubled; ye believe in God.</hi> So much of this first Particular. And before I enter upon the second, I shall make some short Application of this.</p>
            <pb n="86" facs="tcp:134572:51"/>
            <p> First, It follows hence, that <note place="margin">Applicat.</note> Heart-Trouble under the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting Hand of God, argues the <hi>weakness,</hi> if not the <hi>want</hi> of Faith. All those sorts of Heart-Trouble, and the parts of it which I have mentioned, as Heart Sorrow, worldly Sorrow, immoderate Mourning, sinful Fear, vexatious Care, despon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of Spirit, being offended; disturbance of Mind, Distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Dejection, Discouragement, and the like, all these flow from the want of Faith, or, at least, from the weakness of Faith in God. We do not believe in God; we see the Causes of our Troubles, they are mostly in our selves, even our <hi>Ʋnbelief.</hi> What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we profess, we do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in God: If we could but believe in God, our Hearts would not be troubled. O, our want of Faith; let us heartily lament it, and cry to God for Pardon through the Blood of Christ. If our Hearts be troubled, where is
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:134572:51"/> our Faith in God? What doth God, and all that is in God, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify to us? What are we the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for all that infinite All-suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency and Goodness that is in God, if we do not act Faith up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it? Our Heart-Troubles would be cured, could we act Faith on God as we ought to do.</p>
            <p>Immoderate Sorrow then is very unbecoming Believers in God. If we will prove our selves Believers in God, let us discharge our selves from Heart-Trouble, and let us draw out Consolation for our Hearts by Faith, from all those comfortable Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God, and from all those abundant Excellencies that are in God: O let us labour for Faith, and act it; let us live in the exercise of it, and then sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we shall find comfort.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly;</hi> Let us all labour to get an Interest in God, by Faith <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 26.</note> in Jesus Christ, that so we may be able to look upon God as <hi>our</hi> God, and then we may claim an Interest in All that God is, and in
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:134572:52"/> All that God hath, and so shall <note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. 6.</note> we have no cause of Heart-Trouble in any Condition. For if God be ours, All his <hi>Attributes</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 31. 14.</note> are ours, his gracious <hi>Covenant</hi> is ours, his <hi>Word</hi> and Promises are ours: All is ours; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore should we labour in this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things, spending all our Thoughts, Affections and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits upon this. O let us lay hold on God and his Covenant; let us chuse him for our Portion, and resign up our whole selves unfeignedly to him, terminating and centring all our Desires, Hope, Love, Delight in him alone, placing all our Happiness in him, and then commit all to him. <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee? and there is none upon Earth that I desire besides thee,</hi> Psal. 73. 23.</p>

               <p>

               <p>Fifthly, Jesus Christ is called the <hi>Consolation of Israel,</hi> Luke 2. 25. A sweet Name indeed.

               <p>I might largely shew here, that Jesus Christ is the <hi>Consolation</hi> of his People many ways; as by his coming from his Father into the World, to become our <hi>Surety,</hi> to undertake for us, to take our Sins upon him, and to make his Soul an Offering for our Sins; and by his Blood to purchase our <note place="margin">

                  <hi>God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for us.</hi> Of this I have spoken before. Now if we can act our Faith upon the Intercession of Christ, who knows all our Wants, Burdens, Cares and Fears, and whose Office it is to plead and intercede for us in Heaven, (tho we may scarce have any to plead or speak a <note place="margin">

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:134572:74"/> faithful Friend, to whom we may commit our Cause.</p>
               <p>Thirdly; Christ is doing a Work <hi>in us</hi> on Earth, while he himself is in Heaven: He is humbling us, purging us, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">

               <p>Moreover, our Faith should be acted upon the Work that Christ is now doing for us in Heaven; besides his Intercession for us there, he is <hi>preparing a Place</hi> for us in Heaven, as he told his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, to comfort them: <hi>In my Father's House are many Mansions; I go to prepare a Place for you.</hi> A Place in Heaven is infinitely better, and more to be desired than the best Place on Earth.

                  <hi>greater Works than he himself did,</hi> John 14. 12. which was a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Mercy than his <hi>bodily</hi> presence with them, and with this he calms and quiets their Minds. Now if we can act Faith upon the blessed <hi>Ends</hi> of Christ, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving our earthly Comforts from us, which are, to bestow upon us <hi>better</hi> Mercies, to give us more of his Spirit, and of the Graces and Comforts of it, our Hearts would not be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled; could we believe, that Christ's End in all his Chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is, to prepare us for that Place in his Father's House, it would comfort and support us. His Ends are very good, and that should quiet us. So long as the People of Christ enjoy most of the Comforts of this World, (I speak it by sad experience) commonly they enjoy least of God, and of his Spirit; and usually, when Christ takes away their earthly Comforts, then he manifests most of Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and of his tender Love
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:134572:81"/> to them: He brings them into the <hi>Wilderness,</hi> and then <hi>speaks</hi>

                  <hi>comfortably to them;</hi> then he speaks to their Hearts, and not to their Ears only, as in time of Prosperity, then he gives out most of the Graces and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of his Spirit. Christ ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver takes away these outward Mercies from his People, but with <hi>design</hi> to bestow better, if our Discontent and Unbelief do not hinder. When the Lord took away from his Servant <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> the young Child begotten in Adultery, it was to give him a <hi>Solomon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus I have endeavoured to shew what it is also to believe in Christ, that thereby we may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent and cure our Heart-Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>The last thing I have to do is, to shew <hi>how</hi> Faith acted thus on God and Christ, or, on God in Christ, is the best Preventive of, and <hi>Remedy</hi> to cure all our Heart-Troubles, which hath indeed been shewn, partly in the two
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:134572:81"/> former Particulars, and will serve for the confirmation of the Point also.</p>
               <p>Two ways principally Faith acted on God and Christ, doth effect this great Cure of Heart-Trouble, and procure <hi>Hearts-Ease.</hi>

               <p>First, By <hi>Applying</hi> and <hi>Appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating</hi> God and Christ to the Soul, and <hi>All</hi> that God is, and <hi>All</hi> that Christ is, and all that God hath, and all that Christ hath, and <hi>All</hi> that God and Christ hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised: Faith applieth and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriates <hi>All</hi> this to the Soul; Faith gives the Soul <hi>Right,</hi> Title, Claim, Propriety and Interest to, and in God and Christ; Faith makes <hi>All</hi> the Believer's <hi>own.</hi> Believe, and All is thine.

               <p>Either God is ours, or he is not; either Christ is ours, or he is not: If God and Christ be not ours, we have cause enough of Heart-Trouble, cause enough to mind our Danger, and to be troubled at our very Hearts, that we are in such a woful case; and should now above all things la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour after an Interest in God and in Christ; whatever our Losses in the World be, this dangerous State of our Souls

If God be ours, if Christ be ours, <hi>All</hi> is ours, Life ours, Death ours: What if we want Relations and Friends, Honour, Wealth and Health, is not the All-sufficient God e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough?

               <p>Secondly, Faith exercised in Holy <hi>Confidence</hi> in, and <hi>Reliance</hi> upon God, and Christ, and the Promises, will prevent or cure all our Heart-Trouble. <hi>David</hi> was cured both these ways, <hi>Psal.</hi> 31. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. <hi>viz.</hi> by appropriating God to himself, and by trusting in him: <hi>I trusted in thee, O Lord; I said, thou art</hi>

               <p>Trust then, depend and rely upon God in Christ, and by an holy Confidence, resign up your Wills to his Will, to do, what he would have us do; to be, what he would have us be; to suffer, what he would have us suffer; and then Heart-trouble will cease, and sweet Peace cometh: when having trusted all with God, we can in heart say, Lord, if thou wilt have me poor, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced, imprisoned, diseased, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of my dearest friends; I am content to be so, I trust all my Concerns with Thee: O the sweet peace and quiet that will be in that Soul!</p>
               <p>There is the <hi>Al-mightiness,</hi> the <hi>Wisdom, Goodness, Love, Mercy,</hi> and <hi>Faithfulness</hi> of God in Christ for us to trust in, and to rely upon, a <hi>Bottom</hi> and Foundation
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:134572:84"/> strong enough to build our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence upon, in all Storms and Streights: God hath also made many <hi>exceeding great and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Promises</hi> in his Word, and not a <hi>naked Promise,</hi> but he hath entred into Covenant with us, founded upon full satisfaction by the Blood of Jesus, <hi>and confirmed</hi> it with an Oath; and to this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, <note place="margin">

               <p>Upon this sure Foundation then must our Faith act in an holy Confidence in God, and in Christ: the Soul being taken off from all other Objects, carried out of Self, unto God and Christ; who presently (as soon as trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in,) communicate themselves, and their love, and goodness to the Soul, filling it with peace, strength, and settlement. By this trusting in God, we honour
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:134572:85"/> God most, and best provide for our own safety.</p>
               <p>The way then, whereby Faith quieteth the Soul, and cures it of its Troubles, is, by <hi>raising</hi> it above all Disquietments, and <hi>pitching</hi> it solely upon God in Christ; and thereby <hi>uniting</hi> it to God in Christ; from whence it draws vertue and strength, to subdue what ever troubleth its Peace. For the Soul is made for God, and never finds Rest, till it return unto, and settle and center it self upon him again. And that we may thus place our confidence in God and Christ for all supplies, we must most earnestly beg, cry, and seek to God for Grace and Strength so to do; we must trust in God alone, for all things, and at all times: and thus by appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priating God to us, and Christ to us, and placing our confidence in them, we may be cured of all our Heart-troubles.</p>

It is the great Design of God, in all the Troubles he sends upon his People, effectually to teach them the exceeding Vanity of the Creature, to imbitter the things of this World to them, to wean their Hearts from them, to bring earthly things out of Request with them, to make them see, that there is no true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, nor solid Satisfaction for the Soul to be found in them, and to make them see where true Happiness and Contentment <note place="margin">

Now the great Work of Faith is, to take off the Soul from the Creature, and fix and settle it upon God and Christ the true Foundation. Natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our Hearts hang loose from God, and cleave to the Creature, and when the Creature fails, our Hearts are troubled; but Faith takes off the Heart from the Creature, and settles it upon God in Christ, where it finds Rest; and this is the great Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice it doth us. All the great and famous things which those Worthies did, and all the hard and heavy things they suffered, mentioned in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. were all done and suffered by the Power of Faith, <hi>ver.</hi> 37, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of our Hearts upon God in Christ; trusting all there, is the best means to cure our Heart-trouble; and this Faith doth, and therefore it is precious.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Inf. </seg>2</label> Premisses, That the want of Faith in God, and in Christ, is the

Could we but act our Faith strongly on God and Christ, as our God in Christ, our Troubles would be preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or cured: For by Faith the Soul looks up to God in Christ, through the Promises, looking off from all other supports, unto God for all Supplies, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving of all Evil felt or feared, and for the obtaining of all Good promised and needed; and by this exercise of Faith, the Soul is raised up above all Discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Disquietments: but where this Faith is wanting, or the lively exercise of it suspend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there the Soul sinks under Heart-troubles. But of this some-what was said before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly.</hi> Hence also we may <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Inf. </seg>3</label> clearly see the absolute Necessity of getting Faith in God, and in Christ; and of acting it, and living by it: There is no living quietly and comfortably without it, no standing under our Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,

               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly.</hi> Then the Things of <label type="milestone">

The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great and mighty work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Power of God, to raise up the Soul to God and Christ, and to enable it, to lay hold on God and Christ: for such is our

               <p> And having got Faith, we must act and exercise it upon God in Christ; upon God, I say, He onely is the <hi>Object</hi> of Faith, and is worthy of it; for a Man can be in no condition, in which God is at a loss, and cannot help him: If Comforts and means of Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance be wanting, God can <hi>create</hi> Comforts, and <hi>comman<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>As God offers, so Faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives; God offers himself in Christ, and so Faith receives him: God doth, as it were, say in the Gospel, O poor lost Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,

                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 9.</note> Dross.

I say, this is to believe in Christ; and such as thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him, have no cause of Heart-Trouble. And thus we must believe in him, and it is the great Commandment of God to believe in him, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 23. and the positive Command of Christ himself in the Text, <hi>Believe also in me.</hi> And he that hath this Faith, hath Christ, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 10, 12. and <hi>hath Life, Eternal Life.</hi> John 6. 47. <hi>Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, verily, I say unto you,</hi> (saith

               <p>Now, he that thus believes in Christ, Christ is his; and all that Christ hath done, and suffered, and merited, is his, he hath Right and Title to it; for by Faith he is become the Child of God.

What cause hath such a Soul to be dejected, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Crosses or Losses do befal him? Is there not enough in Christ, in the Promises, in the Purchase of Christ? Is there not enough in Heaven, in all that Glory to quiet, content and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to satisfy our Souls? O my Beloved, (and O my base and faithless Heart) it is our base <hi>Ʋnbelief</hi> that doth us all the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, that spoils our Peace, that hinders our Comfort, and makes us walk so heavily.

                  <hi>A.</hi> Briefly thus: If we be Christ's intirely, and sincerely Christ's, then Christ is ours: <hi>I am my Beloved's, and my Beloved is mine,</hi> Cant. 2. 16. &amp; 6. 3. Her being Christ's, was a sure evidence to her that Christ was hers. Now it is not very hard to know whose we are, whether we be Christ's or our own, Christ's or the World's, Christ's or the Devil's: Let us take a little pains in trying and search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our selves, the Matter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it; Whose are we? Put this Question seriously to our Hearts, in the sight of God: Whose am I? whose Image do I bear? by whose Spirit am I acted? who hath my Heart, my chief Love and Delight? Have we unfeignedly given up our selves to Christ? Have we actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:134572:97"/> entred into Covenant with him, and taken him for our Head and Husband? Have we passed over and surrendred up our whole selves to Christ, our Souls, Bodies, all our Concerns? Have we given up our Hearts, Heads, Tongues, Time, Talents, Estates, Liberties, Relations, and all to Christ? Have we done this sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely? Then we have received Christ upon his Terms. If we be Christ's, and not our own, and live unto Christ, and not to our selves, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 9. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 20. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. and are content that Christ should dispose of us and ours as he pleaseth; and are always labouring to be more and more like him, and still longing for more and more Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then may we, upon good Grounds, conclude that Christ is ours: <hi>If we be his, he is ours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, if we truly <hi>believe</hi> in Christ, then he is <hi>ours,</hi> for it is by Faith that we receive him, and are united to him, and made

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:134572:98"/> Word, his People; your Hearts will run out after him, all your Affections will center in him.

               <p>Now certainly he that thus believes in Christ, hath no cause of Heart-Trouble, but quietly submits to the good Will of his God in Christ, under all the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensations of his Providence, while he is here in this Vale of
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:134572:99"/> Tears, until he come home to his Father's House in Peace, where he shall meet his dearest Lord, and an hearty welcome. O this Faith, this precious Faith in Christ will conquer all our base Fears, moderate all our worldly Sorrows, ease our Minds perplexed with earthly Cares, and quiet our disturbed and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted Thoughts about our outward Losses and Troubles: By this <hi>Faith</hi> we shall find all our Losses made up in God and in Christ: O then labour for it, cry mightily to God for this great Gift; cry to Jesus for it, he is the Author and Finisher of <note place="margin">

               <p>I dare affirm, that if any thing bring <hi>Hearts-Ease</hi> in Heart-Trouble, this will do it. So long as our Faith holds up in Act and Exercise upon Christ, we shall be free from Heart-Trouble; but when our Faith sails, our Heart-Troubles pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail:
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:134572:99"/> As when <hi>Moses</hi> lifted up his Hands, (and his Heart too by Faith) <hi>Israel</hi> prevailed; but when his Hands were down, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maleck</hi> prevailed. Faith and Heart-Trouble are like a pair of Ballances, when one goes up, the other goes down: Faith is the Counter-poize of Trouble of Heart: Believe then in Jesus, act Faith on him, and that will prevent or cure Heart-Trouble. Continue in the Faith, and your Heart-Troubles will cease; believe what Christ is, and what he is to us.</p>

Is not this a most comfortable Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to such poor Saints, as have here on Earth no certain dwelling-places, not an House of their own wherein to lay their Heads, but are forc'd to remove from place to place, still seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Habitation, banished from Family and Friends, from Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and Acquaintance; some cast into Prisons, (while others dwell safely in their own Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and none to make them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid,) and others exposed to much hardship and danger; I say, this is good news to them, That in their Father's House are many Mansions; there are ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Habitations ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, made ready for them; from which, when once they are entred, they shall never
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:134572:102"/> be cast out more: from whence there shall be no more any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move for ever.

                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 2, 3.</note> that are there; and let us act Hope also, that shortly we shall possess that Place, and enjoy that blessed State: The believing fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Prospects of that place, will prevent our Heart-trouble, or cure it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If it were not so, I would have told you,</hi> saith our Lord: If there were not such a blessed State, and glorious Place for you my Disciples in the other World, after all your Sufferings in this, I would have told you so: For I have told of the many Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles you must endure in this World; and for your support and comfort, I am now telling you, what good things you shall

               <hi>Quest.</hi> IT may be demanded, That having heard the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and usefulness of this Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Medicine to cure Heart-Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, namely, Faith in God and in Christ; Can you tell us how we may get this Faith? and what means we shall use to obtain it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I shall endeavour, by the help of God's Spirit, and Scripture-Light, to direct you herein, and as briefly as I may.</p>
            <p>First, You must be convinced <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Direct. </seg>I</label> of your <hi>Ʋnbelief,</hi> of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Sin of <hi>Ʋnbelief,</hi> and of your absolute <hi>need</hi> of Faith: Of these three things you must be fully convinced.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Of your <hi>Ʋnbelief;</hi> for most People think they have Faith, and that they never were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:134572:109"/> it, and therefore labour not for it. Pray earnestly therefore that the Holy Spirit may be sent into your Hearts to work this Conviction in you, for it's his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Work, <hi>John</hi> 16. 8. to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the World <hi>of Sin, because they believe not on me,</hi> saith our Lord: this is the <hi>great Sin,</hi> the damning Sin of the World, their <hi>not believing on Christ.</hi> Now that we may be convinced, that by <hi>Nature</hi> we have no Faith, let us consider these Scriptures, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 12. and that until we are regenerate and born again, we have no Faith, is evident from <hi>John</hi> 1. 12, 13. there, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in Christ, and Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are inseparably joined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 9. &amp; 26. 18. &amp; 20. 21. From which Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures it is most evident, that such as are Strangers to the Heart-pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying, the Heart-sanctifying Work of Faith, have no Faith; if we have not truly repented, nor know any saving Change wrought in us, and upon us, by
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:134572:110"/> the Spirit of God; for certain, what-ever we think, we have no true Saving-Faith, it is but a Fancy: of this then we must be fully convinced, and must most heartily beg the help of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to convince us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Of the greatness of the Sin of Unbelief; it binds the Guilt of all other Sins upon us; it is <hi>Disobedience</hi> and <hi>Rebellion</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the great God; for he <hi>commands</hi> us to believe, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 21. and by our Unbelief, we <hi>make God a Liar,</hi> 1 John 5. 10. O horrible Wickedness! And,</p>
            <p n="3">3. We must be convinced also of our absolute need of Faith, we must needs have it, or we must perish. Without Faith it is <hi>impossible to please God,</hi> Heb. 11. 6. without it we cannot be the Children of God, <hi>John</hi> 1. 12. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 26. without it we can have <hi>no pardon of Sin,</hi> Acts 10. 43. Rom. 3. 25. John 8. 24. And in what a dangerous Case are we, so long as we lie under the guilt of all our Sins? With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:134572:110"/> Faith we are <hi>not reconciled to God, nor justified,</hi> Rom. 3. 22. &amp; 5. 1. Nor can we <hi>be sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> Acts 26. 18. 2 Thess. 2. 13. No access to God but by Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 2. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 18. No li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Life of Religion, nor bearing up under Affliction, nor holding out to the End without Faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. No Salvation, nor Eternal Life without it, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 18. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 16, 36. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. <hi>last.</hi> Of all these things we must be convinced, if ever we will have Faith.</p>
            <p>Secondly; If we would have <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Direct. </seg>II,</label> Faith, we must diligently search the Scriptures, read the Gospel, attend on the reading and preaching of the Gospel <hi>for this very end,</hi> that we may get Faith by it: I say, <hi>for this very end,</hi> certainly, that should be our <hi>End</hi> in reading and in hearing the Word, which was God's <hi>End</hi> in publishing of it; now this was his <hi>End</hi> in publishing of it, <hi>John</hi> 20. 21. <hi>Rom▪</hi> 16. 25, 26.
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:134572:111"/>
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 17. <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 48. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 13. This is the ordinary Means appointed by God, to work Faith in the Souls of Men, as appears by <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 42. and 4. 4. and 11. 20, 21. and many more. There are few that read, and hear the Word for this <hi>End,</hi> and therefore get no Faith by it.</p>
            <p>Now that the Word read, and heard, may be effectual to work this precious, this most necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Grace of Faith in us, there are some things <hi>Antecedent,</hi> some <hi>Concomitant,</hi> and some <hi>Consequent</hi> upon our attendance on the Word, and our use of it.</p>
            <p>First; Some things <hi>Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi> are necessary;</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) <hi>Preparation;</hi> For want of this the Word most times proves ineffectual. It is the empty, hungry-Soul that relisheth and taketh in this Food, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 21. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 22. usually our Success is according to our preparation; as in Prayer, <hi>Psal.</hi>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:134572:111"/> 10. 17. compare 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12. 14. with 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. 3. make Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science then of preparation.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) <hi>Prayer:</hi> Pour out your Hearts to God in Prayer for a Blessing on the Word, that you read or hear. O, lift up a Cry to God, and say, Lord, make this Word effectual to work Faith in my Soul, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">(3.) <hi>Earnest Desire and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation</hi> of meeting God in the Word, and of his blessing on it: if we expect nothing from it, no wonder if we receive no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: there is <hi>a fulness of Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing in the Gospel,</hi> Rom. 15. 29. We should bring hungry and thirsty Souls after God, the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 63. 1, 2, 3. and 84. 1, 2. God <hi>filleth the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with good things,</hi> Luk. 1. 53.</p>
            <p>Secondly; Some things are <hi>Concomitant:</hi> As,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) We must read and hear it <hi>as the Word of God, and not as the Word of Man,</hi> 1 Thess. 2. 13. Acts 10. 33. and we must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:134572:112"/> God's Authority in it.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Receive it with Meekness, opening our Hearts to it, and give it the most tender enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 21.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) With Love, readiness of Mind, and gladness of Heart, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 10. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 41.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) With Faith, giving cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to it, believing it to be the Word of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 2.</p>
            <p n="5">(5.) We must be careful to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it: See what great stress is laid upon our remembring, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 2. Our Salvation lies upon it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 11. Love the Word, for Love is the Act of Memory.</p>
            <p n="6">(6.) Prayer must be added a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain for a Blessing.</p>
            <p>Thirdly; Some things must be done afterward also. As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Meditation</hi> upon what you have heard and read; for want of this usually all is lost. I am perswaded, this is one great Reason why most profit so little
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:134572:112"/> by the Word, because they make no Conscience of Meditation; they hear and read, but never think more on it afterwards: So Preaching, Hearing, Reading, and all lost; and Souls, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and all lost. For God's sake then, whose Word you read and hear, and for your own Souls sake, if you are not willing they should perish for want of Faith, make Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Meditation on the Word, <hi>Psal.</hi> 1. 2. and 119. 97. if ever you get good by the Word, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate upon it.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) <hi>Application</hi> of it; take it home to your selves, <hi>Job</hi> 5. 27. Let it sink down into your Hearts, saith Christ; it must be an <hi>ingrafted Word,</hi> you must receive it into your Hearts, and not into your Heads only, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6. your Hearts must be joined to it, and mix'd with it.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) <hi>Practice:</hi> Yielding up our selves to the Government of it, making it the Standard and Rule of our whole Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

               <pb n="208" facs="tcp:134572:115"/>
               <hi>We must be doers of the Word, and not hearers only, lest we deceive our own Souls,</hi> Jam. 1. 22. 1 Pet. 1. 22. Mat. 7. 22, 24. And in observing these Scripture-Rules here laid down, in the careful and conscientious use of God's Word after this manner, you may not doubt but the Holy Spirit of God will work with the Word of God, to make it effectual to work this most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Grace of Faith in us, whereby to believe in God and in Christ, to the Consolation and eternal Salvation of our Souls: But if we neglect the Means God hath ordained to get Faith, and for want of it, die in our Sins, and perish eternally, our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction will be of our selves.</p>
            <p>Thirdly; Would we have <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Direct. </seg>III</label> Faith? let us engage our whole Souls in the deep and serious consideration of the infinite, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable, unconceivable Love of God the Father, in this, the highest and fullest demonstration
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:134572:115"/> of it, in giving his Son, his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begotten Son, to be a Sin-Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, a Sacrifice, a Ransom for poor Sinners, and that for this very end and purpose, that we poor Sinners might believe in him, and by believing, might not perish, but might have Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life. I pray read and pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der upon the following Texts, and let your most serious Thoughts fix on them, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate on them, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; <hi>John</hi> 3. 16, 17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 25. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 8, 10. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 30. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 12, 13. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19, 20, 21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3. &amp; 8. 32. with many other, which for brevity sake I cannot transcribe: If we can but believe this wonderful Love of God the Father, in giving his dear Son to be a <hi>Surety,</hi> a <hi>Sin-Offering, to lay all our Iniquities on him;</hi> that <hi>he was pleased to bruise him, and put him to grief</hi> for us; and consider and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate upon the <hi>Heighth and Depth, the Breadth and Length</hi> of this immense, incomprehensible Love
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:134572:116"/> of God in giving his Son, and that on purpose, that we might believe in him, and by believing might have Eternal Life; I say, it will greatly help us to believe in his Son, to accept of this his unspeakable Gift, and to receive him as he is offered to us in the Gospel.</p>
            <p>Moreover, let us also consider of, and deeply meditate upon the transcendent Love of the Son of God himself; who, though he were the <hi>Delight</hi> of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and lay in the <hi>Bosom</hi> of his <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 30, 31.</note> Father, even then his <hi>Delights</hi> were with the Sons of Men, then was his Heart full of Love to poor Sinners; and his Love brought him down from Heaven to Earth, to assume Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to take upon him all the Sins of his People, to bear them on his Soul &amp; Body, in the Garden, there sweating great drops of <hi>Blood,</hi> and on the Cross, there pouring out his Heart-Blood, made a Curse, endured the full measure of the Wrath of God due for Sin, and
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:134572:116"/> became the Ransom of Souls, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2. 6, 7, 8. <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 44. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. He loved us, and gave himself for us: <hi>Loved us, and washed us from our Sins in his Blood,</hi> Rev. 1. 6. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 18. 1 Pet. 2. 24. Gal. 3. 13. Tit. 2. 14.</p>
            <p>But while I am writing these things, I cannot but conceive an Indignation against my self, and heartily wish, I were filled with shame, sorrow, and grief of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that having read and heard so often of the surpassing Love of God the Father, in giving his Son; and so often of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable Love of Jesus, and to be no more affected with it, no more sensible of it; to have my Affections no more stirred and moved, no more quickned and warmed: Alas, my dead Heart, my Adamantine Heart! Lord, sprinkle it with that Blood, Lord shed abroad that Love of thine upon my Heart abundantly by the Holy Ghost; Lord Jesus, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest thy Love to me, that I may love thee. I am ashamed
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:134572:117"/> and pained for want of Love to God, to Jesus; O that I could believe thy Love to my Soul, then I should not chuse but love thee. Lord, I believe, help my Unbelief. The consideration of this Love of God, and of Christ, is a means to work Faith; try it, I pray you, and you will find it so.</p>
            <p>Fourthly; Improve and act <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Direct. </seg>IV</label> the Historical Faith you have, on the Doctrines, Promises, and Threatnings in the Gospel, which you profess you do believe. Act the Faith you have on the <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 37. &amp; 7. 37. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 28, 29.</note> Doctrines of the Gospel, the Promises of Rest for your Souls, Pardon for your Sins, Life and Righteousness, Grace and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry made to those that believe in Christ, and to none else. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and think what Heaven is, that state of infinite Blessedness, in the seeing and enjoying the Blessed God to all Eternity: Believe what Eternal Life is, <note place="margin">2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1. 9, 10.</note> Eternal Glory; and believe also
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:134572:117"/> what Hell is, separation from God; <hi>Go ye Cursed into Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Fire;</hi> Lakes of Fire and Brimstone, everlasting Death, the Wrath of God, Damnation; and seeing you profess that you believe all this, then believe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so and consider it well, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is Heaven's infinite Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to be attained, nor Hell's unspeakable Misery to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided, but only by believing in the Lord Jesus Christ, <hi>John</hi> 3. 16, 17, 36. <hi>John</hi> 8. 24.</p>
            <p>Fifthly; Would you have <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Direct. </seg>V</label> Faith? then seek it diligently; pray, O pray for it as for your Lives, cry mightily to God for it; pour out your Hearts to God in Prayer for it; pray continually for Faith, pray without ceasing, be importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate with God for it, go all Day and Night panting and breathing after it, O that God would give me Faith! Go to Jesus also for it, cry to him, for he is the Author as well as the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:134572:118"/> Object of it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 1, 2. It it is the Gift of God, O pray for it.</p>
            <p>Lastly; Consider seriously, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Direct. </seg>VI</label> and often, how wonderful wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling God is that you should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Christ, as you have heard; and how much he is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased with those that will not believe in him; and how dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully he hath threatned them, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 8. Also consider how exceeding willing Jesus Christ himself is, that poor Sinners should come to him, and believe in him; how sweetly he calls them, how freely he offers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and All he is, to them, be they never so bad, never so vile and wicked: <hi>Ho, every one that thirsteth,</hi> Isa. 55. 1. they that have no Worthiness in them, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Sin and Misery, <hi>John</hi> 6. 37. &amp; 7. 37. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 18. &amp; 21. 11. O, set your Hearts to the consideration of the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable unparallel'd Love of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, in dying that cursed Death
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:134572:118"/> of the Cross for Sinners: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider and meditate, hold your Hearts to it, until your Hearts be affected with his Love, his Love that passeth the Love of Women, Love passing Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing; and consider how well he deserves, and how much he challengeth your Love. Consider once again, what a most lovely Person Jesus is, who is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 18.</note> lovely, the <hi>Brightness of his Father's Glory, in whom dwells all Fulness,</hi> and in whom is all Power in Heaven and Earth; and labour to affect your Hearts with his most admirable Excellencies, and then come unto him weary and heavy laden with your Sins, willing to part with them all; give up your whole selves to him, give him your whole Hearts, and take him for your Head and Husband, for your only Lord and Saviour; enter actually into Covenant with him, to become his, and his alone, and his for ever. Thus work out your Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and your Consolation,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:134572:119"/> by believing in Jesus, in Blessed, All-sufficient Jesus, trusting to him, betrusting all with him, and God will work in you <hi>both to will and to do,</hi> Phil. 2. 12, 13. Use these Means in the strength of God, and doubt not, but in the use of them, you shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this precious Faith; which having, and acting, you shall find it to be your Hearts-Ease in all your Heart-Trouble.</p>
